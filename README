This project is basically at the prototype stage at the moment, and
can't do much but lay text out.

Check out the comments in the code for how the layout engine
works. Most of the work is done in boxmodel/box.py and
boxmodel/layout.py

getgoogle.py will fetch a page (not google, actually, hah!) and
display the text wrapped nicely. It works as an example of how to use
the layout engine.
